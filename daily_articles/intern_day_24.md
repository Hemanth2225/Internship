Hello  

This my day 24 of Intern. In this day me and my mentor start conversation with English because I have to improve my communication skills. Then I done some crud operation in my angular project.

## Angular project:

I do create read and delete in my angular project using typescript and HTML, styles. Then I read about what is reactive forms, provide a model-driven approach to building forms, allowing you to manage form state and validations directly in the component's TypeScript code. Using reactive form module I will access the form control. Then I create a module in angular A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module. The module is a container for the different parts of an application. Controllers always belong to a module. 

### Ng model:

Then I learn about ng model, The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, text area) to application data. With the ng-model directive you can bind the value of an input field to a variable created in Angular JS. Some example for ng-model.

#### Example:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="mycontrol">
 Name: <input ng-model="name">
</div>
```

### Reactive form:

Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. This guide shows you how to create and update a basic form control, progress to using multiple controls in a group, validate form values, and create dynamic forms where you can add or remove controls at run time.

### Ng-for:

The `ngForof` directive is generally used in the shorthand form `*ngFor`. In this form, the template to be rendered for each iteration is the content of an anchor element containing the directive.

#### Example:

```html
<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i;">...</li>
```

- `Ng` is shortform of angular
- `For` is for loop statement

## English communication:

Me and my mentor talk about some typescript problem and then reactive forms then we talk about angular19, then he teach about how array and object is important in coding then I ask some question from my side and he gave answers to my question we build more conversations in English it is very use for my communication skill.

## Bootstrap classes:

Then finally I end the day with learning bootstrap classes. I learned about some classes in bootstrap like colors, Buttons, background colors. 

### Some colors classes in bootstrap:

- `bg-primary`
- `.bg-success`
- `bg-danger`
- `.bg-dark`
- `bg-light`

### Some button classes in bootstrap:

- `btn btn-outline-primary`
- `btn btn-outline-success`
- `btn btn-outline-warning`
- `btn btn-outline-danger`
- `btn btn-outline-dark`
