Hello  

This is my day 25 of intern I learn about JavaScript what is array and array methods. Then I learn about what is object and difference between array and objects.

## Array:

Again once I recalled about array because array and objects are very important. Array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations, allowing access to each element using an index. Array is a list of items.

### Array methods:

I learned about some array methods; they don't access any internal data of the array object. It only accesses the array elements through the length property and the indexed elements.

- Push( )  
- Pop( )  
- Splice( )  
- Concat( )  

### Push( ):

- A `push()` method adds new items to the end of an array.  
- The `push()` method changes the length of the array.  
- The `push()` method returns the new length.  

#### Example:

```javascript
const boys=["Hemanth", "kalam", "Sumesh", "Sudhan"];
boys.push("Jeeva", "Raj");
console.log(boys);
```

### Pop( ):

I learned how to pop the element in an array using the `pop()` method, I learned with some examples I mentioned below.

- A `pop( )` method is used to remove the last element of an array.  
- The `pop()` method changes the original array.  
- The `pop()` method returns the removed element.  

#### Example:

```javascript
const boys=["Hemanth", "kalam", "Sumesh", "Sudhan"];
boys.pop();
```

In this example, `Sudhan` element is removed from the array.

### Splice( ):

I learned how to use `splice()`. Splice is a method that adds and removes elements. I learned with some examples I mentioned below.

- The `splice()` method adds and/or removes array elements.  
- The `splice()` method overwrites the original array.  

#### Example:

```javascript
const boys=["Hemanth", "kalam", "Sumesh", "Sudhan"];
boys.splice(2, 2);
```

Output: `Hemanth, kalam`

## Execution stack:

In the session, I learned about the execution stack. When a JavaScript application is run, a data structure called **Stack** is used to hold the functions called and the information they store, and this is called the **Execution Stack**. In programming, the `main` function executes first; after `main`, other functions execute. In a stack box, the first box always contains `main`. In the session, Koushik explained with an example of a stack box. With that example, I easily understood the structure of the execution stack.

## Copy writing:

I did copywriting at my home. I copy-wrote an article about my favorite cricket player **Hardik Pandya**. I wrote **1000+ words** about his beautiful journey in cricket. I wrote about all ups and downs in his career and how he overcame those downs, and again how he shined. These things I covered in that copywriting.
