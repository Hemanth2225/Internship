# Hello

This is my day 34 of intern. In this day I did forex service for my trading website. Then I learn about interface keyword, I connected API using API keys with help of http in angular. Then I learn about how to make my API value into dynamic.

## RXJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript):

I learn about RXJS, what is RXJS It is a library that enables you to work with asynchronous and event-based data streams using observables.

### For example:

• API responses  
• Timers  
• User input  
• Web socket, etc

## Providers:

I learn about provider, It is a mechanism used to specify how a dependency should be instantiated when requested by a component or service.

## Session:

Today we have session about mobile web development by Joyal. We learn the steps of how to create a mobile web application. I mention below what are the steps to create mobile web application.

• Research  
• Wireframing  
• Design  
• Development

### Research: 

First, we need to research what is required for a mobile application. For example, if I want to build a coffee app, I need to research what features are necessary, such as the menu, cart, payment options, filters, etc. Then, I should identify and specify the most important requirements for the coffee application. 

### Wireframing:

After researching, we need to create wireframes to connect the pages. For example, if I’m on the home page and I click on the menu, it should take me to the menu page. I will create a blueprint for that navigation. What is wireframe, It is a basic, simplified blueprint that outlines the structure and functionality of an app before detailed design and visual elements are added.

### Design:

After wireframing we must design for application using Figma with good UI. we must design according to selected constrains. And user experience also more important.

### Development:

After design we must move to development side. For mobile web applications we use flutter platform for development it is cross platform it supports both android and iOS. We use Dort language in flutter.
