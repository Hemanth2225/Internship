Hello

                 
This is my day 29 of intern. In this day I learn about routing in angular then I also learn about how to config one page to another page using angular.

## Web-Trading app project:

I completed my home page with register button, sign in button and google sign in button then I use some CSS for buttons, text and background, I also use gradient colour for background and text colour. I start learning about routing because I want to connect one screen to another screen. finally, I did route in angular. Now I started developing registration page.

## Routing:

Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view. Routing is the process of path selection in any network. Routing is used for handling the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router. If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a Single Page Application, with no page reloading, you can use the Ng Route module.

## Pixel and rem:

### Pixel
Pixels are one of the most common length units in CSS.  pixel is formally defined as 1/96 of an inch. But pixel have one minus if I put the pixel size for my display screen then I implement the project in another system the pixel will be change for other display. My mentor suggest me to use rem.

**Example for pixel:**
```css
h1 {
    font-size: 60px;
}
