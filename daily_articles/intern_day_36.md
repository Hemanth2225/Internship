# Hello

This is my day 36 of intern. In this day I learn about what is firebase hosing, how to host in firebase, then I saw some command in firebase. I tried to host my notepad project in fire base but it still pending.

## Firebase:

What is firebase, Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform owned by Google, designed to simplify app development and deployment. It provides a suite of cloud-based tools that help developers focus on building features and user experience while leaving backend management to Google's infrastructure.

## Session:

In this session, I learned about data management. I learned what data is and how to store it securely. I also understood the importance of data structuring, the concepts of primary keys and foreign keys, and the different types of data structures.

## Primary key:

I learn about primary key what is primary key. A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It's like a fingerprint for each record, ensuring no two rows have the same primary key value. Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique within the table. This prevents duplicate records.

## Foreign key:

Then I learn about foreign key what is foreign key. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that establishes a link to a primary key in another table.

### For example:

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.  
- **Foreign Key**: A column that refers to a primary key in another table, creating a link between them.

## Types of data structuring:

- FIFO (First in First out)  
- LIFO (Last in First out)

### FIFO:

In a data structure where the first element added to a container is also the first element removed. For example, think of it like real life example, A queue in a store the first person in line is the first one served. This is the great example of FIFO.

### LIFO:

In a data structure where the most recently added element is the first to be accessed or removed. For example, if you put balls into a box and later want to take them out, you will take out the last ball you put in first. This is an example of LIFO.
