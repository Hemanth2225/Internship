# Hello

This is my day 29 of intern. In this I did login page for my trading web application with using angular. Then I learn about how to make background with gradient colour. Then I also learn about linear colour text colour. Then I had a session about how should interact with ai efficiently. I also learn about prompting techniques.

## Some examples of AI models:
- Google Gemini  
- ChatGPT  
- Deep seek  
- Claude  

### Google Gemini:

Gemini had 1000000 tokens it allows processing more information’s it is common based AI model.

### Claude:

Claude had 200000 tokens it allows Processing less information comparing Gemini. It can only process certain number of tokens. It is good for code work.

### Tokens:

Token is a fundamental unit of data that is processed by algorithms, Tokens play an essential role in AI systems. Tokens are the unit of words that the ai model will easily understand.

#### Key points:
- Tokens consume context window space  
- English averages ~0.75 tokens per word  
- 1 page of text ≈ 250-300 tokens

#### Examples:
 
                "Hello world" → ["Hello", "world"]

In this example Hello is one token then world is one token

### Embeddings:

Embeddings are numerical representations of data like text, images, or audio that capture semantic relationships and are used by machine learning models to understand and process complex information. AI can measure semantic similarity by calculating distance.

---

### Memory Banks:

I learned about Memory banks. It is a designated segment of memory where specific data is stored. Memory Bank designed for address the limitation of an ai model. Memory bank can access past context and data.

---

### Centralized storage:

Centralized storage is system where all AI models' data, including learned information and context, is stored in a single, accessible location, rather than being distributed across multiple devices or models. In this storage Data is stored in a single, easily accessible location.

### Workflow of AI:

When I am asking an ai to give website it will works very well but never blindly implement AI-generated code once you cross check and implement the code. The workflow of AI model is creating new project with .md file like example Create plan.md then create task.md then give whatever features you want, and update documentation AI update these files after every meaningful change to maintain project consistency. Then new task is created.

### Copy writing:

I read and wrote the chapter 2 of extreme ownership; what I got from chapter two:

Leadership defines the performance of a team. Even in the toughest situations, the difference between success and failure lies in the quality of leadership, not the ability of the team. A strong leader sets the tone drives the culture and takes full responsibility for both success and failure. When leaders take extreme ownership, they inspire their teams to rise, take responsibility, and perform at the highest level regardless of the challenges.
