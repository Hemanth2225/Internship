This is my day 20 of intern. In this day. I came at 10o clock then I would start the day at 1 cup of
water then I read about HTML And CSS because I have to develop my trading website I learn about
html tags like title tag, heading tags, paragraph tag, a tag, div tag, etc. what is title tag does means its
help to save the title of web page it shows in top of the website. Then I learned about attribute tag what
is does means defines a hyperlink the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Then
along with a tag I also know about how to add the image in html. What is image tag does means used
to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
then I learn one think in image tag what that means you should also contain
the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image. In image tag we also
put alternate thinks every image it’s called alt attribute. What it does means required alt attribute for
the image tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
Then I learned about style attribute. It is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and
more. Then now I learn about heading tags HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to
display on a webpage. It is used to create a heading in html it is very interesting to learn. HTML
headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the
least important heading then in between headings are decrease in size step by step. h1 headings should
be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings then the less important h3 is less than h2. Then I
learn about paragraph tag, A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add
some white space a margin before and after a paragraph you type anything in paragraph tag it also
displays in website. HTML have the HR tag it means horizontal tag it creates a horizontal line. Br tag it
means break tag it is used to break the line and start in new line. Then I learned about html formatting it
contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning. Some formatting elements are bold,
italic, strong, subscript, superscript, etc. Bold is used to bold the sentence, italic is used to style the
sentence to italic style, strong is used to strong the important text then The content inside is typically
displayed in bold, subscript is used to subscript the word, then superscript is used to superscript the
words. Then I learned about table tag HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and
columns. It created with table rows and table data is also called tr and td. Then TH is table heading it is a
heading of the table. Then HTML tables can have borders of different styles and shapes.add a border,
use the CSS border property on table, th, and td elements. You want avoid having double borders set the
CSS border-collapse property to collapse. This will make the borders collapse into a single border. If
you want set the background colour for table, we, must you background-colour and select the colours.
Then I learned how to set the border radius with help of border-radius property it makes borders rounded
corners. Then I learned about how to put border colour using border-colour.HTML tables can have
different sizes for each column, row or the entire table. Use the style attribute with
the width or height properties to specify the size of a table, row or column. We must add the style
attribute inside the table tag then we have to set the width of the table. It is very useful for me. Then
same width method appears in height also. Then I learned about div tag the div element is used as a
container for other HTML elements. We have to declare the width and height color of the div. The div
element is often used to group sections of a web page together. Then I learned about very basics of CSS
like colors, background color, borders, padding, margin these topics are I covered in day 20. In CSS
colors are classify into color codes each color has a individual code it start with #. Color changes the
color of the text then background color changes the background color in page. Then I learned about
background-image in CSS, the background-image property specifies an image to use as the background
of an element. It is called by URL. The background-image property repeats an image both horizontally
and vertically. We also give a property of background no repeat it is used to not repeat the background.
Then I learned about margin. Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined
borders. It declared with pixel, rem etc. The CSS margin properties are used to create space around
elements, outside of any defined borders. We have moved the individual side of margin using margin
top, margin left, margin right, margin bottom. Margin top is used to add the margin from top, margin left
is used to add the margin from left, margin right is used to add the margin from right, , margin bottom is
used to add the margin from bottom. Then I learned about basic of padding Padding is used to create
space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. These things are I learned in day 20 of
intern. Then the session was started at 11:30 I that session I would learn about function I do some
problem-solving functions then how primitive does not change the value I saw about that. Then list how
changes the values. Then I learn about what is dead function. Then after the session I have some break to
relax then I again recall with that html and CSS. In afternoon session Koushik conducted the assessment
for checking how much we can understand in class. That assessment question paper is filled with
function problem. I wrote the test and submitted to Kaushik. Then afternoon session is conducted by
Huskin he gave some advice about how responsibility is important how we take our life ownership we
have taken responsibility for leaning new thinks and put 200 percent effort. Then don’t work for
someone say just work for your career take responsibility and take ownership your life and work for you
then learn new things update new things. He say example for reasonability we all are responsible to
parents because we love parents like that we have to take responsivity about our career. Then shared
about some fresher start with low knowledge and now building the milestone. Then he tells AI positives
and negatives. Then he say go and set the goal with your mentors. Then after that session I go back and
revise CSS little then I do a simple problem solving in HTML and CSS.
