# Hello

This is my day 27 of intern. In this day I did alert function while clicking delete button. I learned about ng controllers, angular scope, angular service. I got many errors in my project, but I learn many things with debugging the errors.

## ng controllers:

I learned about Ng controller, what is ng controller ng controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. Then its controllers are regular JavaScript Objects. AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers. The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

## Angular scope:

Then I learn about angular scope what is angular scope does, the scope is the binding part between the HTML view and the JavaScript controller. The scope is an object with the available properties and methods. The scope is available for both the view and the controller. When I make a controller in AngularJS, I pass the $scope object as an argument. When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.

## Angular service:

I learned about angular service what is angular service, In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for and limited to your AngularJS application. AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service. The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page. Then I learn about some services in angular.

- $http Service
- $timeout Service
- One more service is there I learn these two service today that one more service called $interval service

### $http Service:

- The $http service is one of the most common used services in AngularJS applications.
- The service makes a request to the server, and lets your application handle the response.

### $timeout Service:

- The $time service is used for setting up a delay in the execution of a function.
- If you want to add a popup on the page, but it should be executed after it is loaded, then you can use the $timeout service. 

## Session:

In todayâ€™s session I learned about asynchronized function with some task examples. Then we talk about what and all synchronize programming language like example Java is synchronize programming language. Then JavaScript asynchronized programming language then Koushik wrote some task functions in asynchronized format for example.

## Copy writing:

I read and wrote the chapter 1 in *Extreme Ownership*. Chapter 1 explains the importance of extreme ownership. The chapter one tells a leader must take full responsibility for everything under their command instead of blaming others. They should own mistakes, find solutions, and ensure the team understands and executes the plan effectively.
