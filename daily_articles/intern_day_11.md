Hello
 This is my day 11 of Intern. Yesterday session Is not there we all are joined with our mentors,
then I learn about how to find the flow for application. Then I searched for how to find the flow for
application then my mentor gave one task compare top 5 trading apps then then see the flow then write
pros and cons for that applications then I search how to validate pros and cons. Then I find pros and
cons for 3 applications with help of that pros and cons condition. While seeing I learn about what is
user friendly, user experience and user interface.

Many app what to change more, my mentor say do the app from scratch with reference of pros and
cons taken from that top 5 apps. Then I searching what are the features in top 5 apps then I note down
that. Many apps not have user friendly. The menu are very complicated. So that's why I will create user
friendly trading application. Then I thick about how to do trading application then I note down the key
factors, I will note down. Then I searched about how to think like professional then I learn about some
points.
