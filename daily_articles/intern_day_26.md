This is my day 26 of intern. I does update in my angular task list project, then I learned about data binding in angular 19.

## Angular project:

I does the update function in my project I complete the crud operation. First I does the create operation then I does read and delete and finally I complete the update. Then I also use local storage for save the data in local storage, I use:

```typescript
localStorage.setItem('My_task', JSON.stringify(this.taskList));
```

for saving the data in local storage. then display the local storage data on display screen. I mentioned below what my project does.

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

### Create:

I use create operation to create a task and save the task in the display screen.

### Read:

I use read operation for accessing and retrieving data from a storage device or memory location.

### Update:

I use update operation for update the already saved task in local storage. I also create an update button inside the list.

### Delete:

I use delete operation for delete the task from display and also delete from local storage.

## Session:

In this session I does some problem solving in JavaScript functions with help of execution stack. When a JavaScript application is run, a data structure called Stack is used to hold the functions called and the information they store, and this is called the Execution Stack. Then Koushik gave some examples for synchronize task and asynchronized task.

## Copy writing:

I wrote the article of Virat Kohli, I wrote about how his cricket career starts then how he handle his fatherâ€™s death while team is on critical situation, then I wrote about his IPL career how he make the milestone in IPL career, I wrote about his international career and his aggressive captaincy in international career, then I wrote about India make the history in Gabba Australia.

## Conclusion:

My angular project using crud operation teach many things to think, to execute then compared with first week intern now my researching is improved. I learn about how to talk with Google and ChatGPT.
