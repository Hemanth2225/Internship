## Day 21 of Internship

### Learning About Angular

This is my **Day 21** of the internship. On this day, I learned about **Angular**. It is a **framework and platform** for building web applications. It is written in **TypeScript** and provides the structure of the code, so we don’t have to write everything from scratch.

Then, I learned how to **install Angular** in **VS Code** using the command prompt. I also learned about **components**. Components are the **core** of Angular applications, responsible for defining both the **structure (HTML) and logic (TypeScript).**

### Web Design Task

My mentor gave me a task to **create a web design using HTML and CSS**. I started by designing a **Car Rental Web Page**.

#### HTML Structure
- I used **`div` tags** to create containers and store headings and other content.
- I used **heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)** and **paragraph tags (`<p>`)**.
- I added a **navbar**, which works similarly to a `div` tag but is specifically used for navigation.

#### CSS Styling
I applied various CSS properties to my web page:

- **Padding**: Moves elements inside a `div` using `px`, `rem`, etc.
- **Margin**: Moves the entire `div` using `px`, `rem`, etc.
- **Background Color**: Changes the background color of a `div`.
- **Text Color**: Changes the text color.
- **Background Image**: Sets a background image for the `body`.
- **Align Items**: Aligns text elements within a `div`.
- **Background Position**: Defines whether the background scrolls or remains fixed.
- **Gaps**: Adds space between words.
- **Hover Effects**: Applies styling changes when hovering over an element.

I completed **half of the web design** on this day.

### JavaScript Events

I attempted to use **JavaScript functions** in my web design but didn’t complete that part. However, I did learn about **events** in JavaScript.

I explored different types of **events in JavaScript**, which are used to handle user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, key presses, etc.

These are the things I learned and worked on during **Day 21**.
