Hello
 This is my day 14 of intern. In this day I searched about many things like authentication and I
searched about API what is authentication means verify the users input with stored data example
username with password then biometric etc this are a authentication then I learn about what is API it
means Application Programming Interface its used to communicate with other software then it receive
data from frontend and mask the data then put in backend then backend gives the data to API it gives to
frontend.
Then I started the first page of my trading application I searched lot of things like what and all
wants for first page then I started account page as first page that page contains account balance then
deposit and withdraw then transaction history then details and with open position, pending position
then closing position and close all the position. Then I put the design in bottom with account, watchlist,
chart then profile. Then session would start at 2 30 in that session I learn about programming languages
like keywords, tokens, datatypes, this and all.
