Hello
 This is my day 12 of intern. In this day session is not there, I finally complete the research
with trading applications. then I collect the idea from more trading application and websites then I wrote
key features of all trading applications then I wrote the cons and I trying to rectify that then I learn about
what and all important for trading applications then I note it down. Then my mentor says put the design
for your trading application with add the pro from the research and rectify the cons from research then I
start to put design in my notebook.
Then I think about starting page it would be simple page with registration, login, then register or login
with google. Why I design the login page very simple means because easy to register and login and
getting happy trade for the users so thatâ€™s why. Then I did not add the KYC in starting register because
KYC is little big process with verification some time people not have interest to do with KYC in staring
so I do with simple registration with Full name, Email, Country, Then password with strong security.
Then I do with Figma I referred with many design and did some designs.
