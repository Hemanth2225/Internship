Hello

         This is my day 10 of intern, in that session I learned about compound interest and simple interest. Then we discussed difference between simple and compound interest and simple interest. What is simple interest meaning an interest is not grown it will be constant then compound interest is multiplying with percentage then its grow more. We have to developed skill like compound interest. With the example of compound interest, we have developed skill like inverse triangle. What are inverse triangle skillsets meaning the skill developed like example Hardik is a batsman he also developed bowling skill and fielding skill then he also developed the skill in pressure handling and captaincy this the example of inverse triangle and compound multiplying the skill is called compound. 




Then after session I got one task by my mentor that task is think how Instagram is generating the money. Then I think about that I got some answers like advertising, shopping and monetization tools for creators. Then he told think about what does you want to change then I think lot of silly point then I think about how to change my think, only efforts can be change my thinking. Then my mentor gave another task think what features we want to add in Instagram for help Instagram to make profit. Then I write some points.
