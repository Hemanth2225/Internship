Hello
 This is my day 15 of intern. That day I searched about colour combinations for my
application design. Then I finally select some colours and design the application then I put the candle
stick with rectangle and lines in the first page of trading application page. Then I create a account
creation page with many account types like standard account, pro account, raw spread account, zero
account. Then standard account is account for all type of traders then pro account is for pro traders with
low spread and high deposit, in this application one type of account is there for beginners called standard
cent this account type is for beginners with mid spread and low investment.
Then I put all the account type in one frame then I put that frame into that account creation frame then
reduce that account types frame size into mobile frame size then I click clip content then I click the
protocol and select horizontal scroll. Then session was start at 4:30 in that session I learn about data type
like integer, string, Boolean. Then I learn about importance of money how many plays in world. Then
money are use full or not many things.
